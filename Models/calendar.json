We'll often have additional swag courtesy of Stern Pinball, Bounce Milwaukee or area breweries or distilleries.\r\nWe will usually rotate through the following pins: Godzilla, Deadpool, The Mandalorian, Avatar, Judge Dredd, Stargate, Starship Troopers, Star Wars EP1, Star Trek, Stern Star Wars, Demolition Man, Terminator 2, Spiderman and James Bond (and sometimes a few more or less)\r\nThis is an IFPA - International Flipper Pinball Association sanctioned tournament, and we will pay the IFPA fees for all players. Format will generally be 7 rounds of 7\/5\/3\/1, but may vary some months.\r\nThis is an all-ages tournament; on nights that we have 3 or more players under 15, we'll have a separate ceremony and trophy for that age group, but under-15s can (and sometimes do!) place in the regular tourney as well.\r\nThere's no need (or way) to register in advance - just come on in!\r\nThis is also very open to new players - whether you're experienced or this is your first one, come on in and we'll show you the ropes. Thanks to our Tournament Director (and pinball tech) Nate Oines for organizing every month!\r\n-------------\r\nMachines are on free play, so you have a few options on how to enter:\r\n$7 = Unlimited pinball (and arcade) games plus tournament entry\r\nOR\r\nBuy a Bounce or Everything wristband and the tournament entry will be included. You can come early and bounce, climb, laser tag, Magnetag, build forts, or play any of our pins or arcade games.\r\n--------------\r\nOther details:\r\n-Kitchen, bar and venue open until 9pm.\r\nDuring, before or after the tournament, check out the 50\/50 tournament to benefit Project Pinball Charity!\r\nWe don't normally play extra balls , but will play them when there's a side tournament (like the Spider-Man 50\/50 or machine-specific side-tourneys from Stern).",

This is an organized regular tournament that we have once per month. Anyone who wants to play is welcome to attend. Everyone on Saturday nights competes in the organized tournament, but you can still play anything you want at practice, in-between rounds, and when it is over. New players are welcome and I will walk you through how it works when you get here. It's a lot of fun and not stressful at all. You are here to have a good time and you absolutely will!\r\n\r\nThe $20 Fee covers the main tournament, all game play, bottled water and soda, and payouts. $25 Fee covers all that, plus a few adult beverages. Pay in person when you come to Jim's. This is an individual event and not a team event. Practice starts at 4:30 PM and tournament starts at 5 PM. We will be capping these events at 28 people, for now, so it is highly encouraged you register or RSVP with me in advance. To register please either email me through the website, or through the Facebook group(preferable...contact me for info).\r\n\r\n\r\nMain Event:\r\n\r\nWe play 10 Rounds of group match play style pinball with Swiss Seeding. Don't worry if you don't know what that is I can explain it to you very quickly when you show up. You play anything you want during practice from 4:30PM-5PM. Then we start the tournament at 5PM. In-between the 10 rounds of play there will be some down time and you can play anything you want. All games are on Free Play. We play 10 rounds each night. Each round consists of 1 randomly selected game that you play with 3(or 2) other people. Based on your score for that game you will either get 1st (7 points), 2nd (5 points), 3rd (3 points) or 4th (1 points). Scoring is 7-4-1 for 3-player groups.Then on the subsequent rounds the computer will match you up on a different game typically with different players who have a similar cumulative points earned for the night as you do. The top 3 players overall will receive payouts. Each tournament will also earn you some WPPR (World Pinball Player Ranking) points and get you both a State of Wisconsin and International ranking with the IFPA.\r\nTGP--10 rounds\/games of group\/4 player match play=20 games toward TGP(80%) ",

Thanks to our Tournament Director (and pinball tech) Nate Oines for organizing every month!\r\n-------------\r\nMachines are on free play, so you have a few options on how to enter:\r\n$7 = Unlimited pinball (and arcade) games plus tournament entry\r\nOR\r\nBuy a Bounce or Everything wristband and the tournament entry will be included. You can come early and bounce, climb, laser tag, Magnetag, build forts, or play any of our pins or arcade games.\r\n--------------\r\nOther details:\r\n-Kitchen, bar and venue open until 9pm.\r\nDuring, before or after the tournament, check out the 50\/50 tournament to benefit Project Pinball Charity!\r\nWe don't normally play extra balls , but will play them when there's a side tournament (like the Spider-Man 50\/50 or machine-specific side-tourneys from Stern).",

Event info can be found by going to next.matchplay.events on your phone and searching Enterrium during the tourney. Four rounds of balanced matchplay on 25-30 pins at Enterrium for qualifying. 7\/5\/3\/1 scoring. Top 16 players qualify for playoffs as long as there are at least 32 players, otherwise top 8. Anyone tied at the 16th place cut line will play a single ball tiebreaker on a random classic pin. All other ties will be broken automatically in matchplay. Playoffs consist of groups of 4 playing a single randomly chosen game, top 2 in each game advance until only 4 players remain. Those 4 players will play a single 4 player game to determine final finishing positions. High seed in each group gets to go last. There is no game selection in any rounds of playoffs due to time constraints at the location.\r\nPayouts for top 8:\r\n5th-8th: $10\r\n4th: 10% of prize pot\r\n3rd: 20% of prize pot and a $10 Enterrium game card\r\n2nd: 30% of prize pot and a $20 Enterrium game card\r\n1st: 40% of prize pot and a $30 Enterrium game card\r\nFormat and arena list are subject to change at TD discretion. TD rulings and format decisions are final. Arguing rulings\/formats with event TDs may result in a yellow card. IFPA\/PAPA pinball rules are generally followed, but TDs reserve the right to differ from these rulings.
